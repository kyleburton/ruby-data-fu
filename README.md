# Developing your Ruby Data-FU

Master of File Processing

This is a talk about the file and data processing features of Ruby which are based on or inspired by features pioneered in Perl, awk and sed.  At one point in my career I worked for a large data processing company and we used many of these techniques to perform simple ETL processing, data preperation, or rudimentary data analysis.
